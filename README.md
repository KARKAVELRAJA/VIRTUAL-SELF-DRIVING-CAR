# VIRTUAL-SELF-DRIVING-CAR

###  VIRTUAL VERSION OF THE SELF-DRIVING CAR THAT CAN DETECT THE OBSTACLES, ROADS AND MOVE ACCORDINGLY

- Self-driving cars use technology to replace driver assistance with automated safety features to navigate on roads
- Virtual Self-driving Car is the virtual version of the real Self-driving Car
- Virtual Self-driving Car uses camera to detect the obstacles and roads, similar to the real Self-driving Car and move accordingly
- Only difference is that the Virtual Self-driving Car runs on the virtual environment whereas the real Self-driving Car runs on the real world
- In this project, the Virtual Self-driving Car automatically runs on the virtual environment without driver assistance using the camera to detect the path and move accordingly
